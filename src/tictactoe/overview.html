	  <h4>Summary</h4>
	  <p> TicTacToe is an engine for testing tictactoe player strategies, new players need to extend Player. The program serves as a platform, for demonstrating basic principles of Object Oriented Programmer (OOP):
	  Inheritance, Polymorphism and Dynamic Binding. Assignment also serves as a teaching aid to teach someone how to think. Writing an optimal player is not easy. You will have to think about it, test various strategies and sleep on it. It is a good idea to think about how to write your program before going to bed. In the morning have a tablet of paper nearby so you can write any ideas that come to mind while sleeping. <strong>Nota Bene</strong> TicTacToe your player needs to play with this engine on submit, but you do have to make some changes in Main methods to get program to compile, and you may want to explore various debug modes.</p>

      <ol>
          <li>Write a basic Random player that extends Player</li>
          <li>All extended player classes, must have only a default null constructor, which calls super( realNamewTerm, avatar), </li>
          <li>where RealNamewTerm is your real name with current term (such as Joe Student Sp14);</li>
          <li>avatar is your combat name. </li>
          <li>You have only one default null constructor, no other constructors.
          <li>You will need to implement all Abstract methods inside of Player</li>
          <li>Modify goForIt.java so that your random player and only your random player interfaces to the engine, initially random player  plays against itself</li>
          <li>You may need to comment out players, that you don't have</li>
          <li>Formulate a strategy to create a better player (i.e., sbusername ), create it, and then test it against your random player</li>
          <li>Your <a href="http://cim.saddleback.edu/~tdedonno/submit/">submitted</a> player must be your  Saddleback Username, both class name and file name must be Saddleback Username</li>
          <li>If you have helper classes make sure they are friendly, you can only submit one file i.e., sbusername.java</li>

      It is recommended you write players in this order...
      <ol>
        <li>First level Player: pick any square (even one occupied)</li>
        <li>Second Level Player: Find an available square (PlayerNext)</li>
        <li>Third Level Player: Look for 2 in a row to win Game or block 2 in a row by opponents</li>
        <li>Fourth-Final Level: Solve the game, but use previous ones for system testing.</li>
      </ol>
      * Only your final submit player should be class SBUserName, where SBUserName is your Saddleback User Name,
      (aka First Initial, Last Name, Unique Number; submit login name).
